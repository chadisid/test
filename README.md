### Object Oriented Design 

- Classes and Objects ;
- Software should be robust that handle unexpected input

# Adaptability and portablity 
- that it can run cross platform without many changes

# Reusability
- The component can be used in Different doftwares. 

# Object-Oriented Design Principles
## Abstraction
- This gives DS gives rise to ADTs. An ADT specifies what each operation does, but not how it does it.
- An ADT is realized by a concrete DS, which is modeled in C++ by a class.
## Encapsulation
- which states that different components of a software system should not reveal
the internal details of their respective implementations.
## Modularity
- Modern software systems typically consist of several different components that must interact correctly in order for the entire system.
## Design patterns
- Some of the algorithm design patterns we discuss include the following:
		Recursion 
		Amortization 
		Divide-and-conquer (Section 11.1.1)
		Prune-and-search, also known as decrease-and-conquer (Section 11.5.1)
		Brute force (Section 12.3.1)
		The greedy method (Section 12.4.2)
		Dynamic programming (Section 12.2)
- Likewise, some of the software engineering design patterns we discuss include:
		Position (Section 6.2.1)
		Adapter (Section 5.3.4)
		Iterator (Section 6.2.1)
		Template method (Sections 7.3.7, 11.4, and 13.3.3)
		Composition (Section 8.1.2)
		Comparator (Section 8.1.2)
		Decorator (Section 13.3.1)
